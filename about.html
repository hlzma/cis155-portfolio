                If you're not a local of the Mariana Islands, then you probably have never heard of it
                before. The Mariana Islands is home to the islands of Guam, Saipan, Tinian, and Rota, located
                in the Pacific Ocean and was discovered by a Portugal explorer named Ferdinand Magellan. 
                Magellan called the islands "Islas de Los Ladrones" which translates to "Island of
                Theives" due to a misunderstanding of property rights. The Mariana Islands, or just Marianas
                for short, is an archipelago chain of 9 other islands with two active volcanos located in
                the Pacific Ocean, with four islands being completely inhabited by locals called Chamorros.
                The islands had a great involvement during World War II. Tinian island was where the nuclear
                bomb was secretly held a few days before the Enola Gay delivered the drop on Japan. Saipan
                island was said to be the last location of where Amelia Earhart was last seen. And Guam island
                has housed a United States Air Force Base for the Pacific Region since the 1940s.

                Our food has evolved and has been borrowed by many other cultures near the islands over the
                past few decades due to World War II and immigrants migrating to the islands from nearby places.
                Some of our local food originates from the Philippines and Japan, and has been modified and
                tweaked by numerous Chamorro families and individuals throughout centuries. The locals usually
                call our food "Chamorro Food" or if food is served during a big local community event, it is
                called, "Fiesta Food". A fiesta plate, or BBQ plate, is usually a mix of many personal preferences,
                such as red or white rice. Or maybe red AND white rice! BBQ chicken, ribs, or beef that has been
                marinated overnight in soy sauce, onions, and lemon &mdash; and then bar-be-qued to flavorful
                perfection!
